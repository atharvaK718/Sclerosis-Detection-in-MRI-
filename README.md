# Sclerosis-Detection-in-MRI-
Deep learning-based framework for automated sclerosis detection in MRI scans using Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs). The system leverages transfer learning, data augmentation, and attention-enhanced architectures to achieve high diagnostic accuracy, supporting radiologists in early detection and monitoring of Multiple Sclerosis.
